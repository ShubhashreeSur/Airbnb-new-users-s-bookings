# Airbnb-new-users-bookings
New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand. 

So, given some details of a new user like demographic details, web session records and summary statistics, who has just signed up in the Airbnb platform, we want to predict in which country the new user will book into. There are 12 possible outcomes of the destination country: 'US', 'FR', 'CA', 'GB', 'ES', 'IT', 'PT', 'NL','DE', 'AU', 'NDF' (no destination found), and 'other'.
